# Universal Bridge

**Universal Bridge** is a mechanism that allows any token to be transferred from another network to Everscale and then to other networks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the moment, the Universal Bridge does not support working with two outside networks.
{% endhint %}

At the [step of choosing a token to send](../cross-chain-transfer/how-to/transferring-from-another-network-to-everscale.md#select-token-and-amount) to Everscale, you can add any missing token to the list:

1. Copy the **Root address** of this token (you can find it using blockchain explorer), and then paste it into the **Token line**.&#x20;
2. Then click Import and confirm this action.&#x20;

Now this token will be displayed in the general list of tokens!
