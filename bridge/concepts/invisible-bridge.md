# Invisible Bridge

### What is an invisible bridge and how it is arranged

**Invisible bridge** is a mode of bridge operation that involves two transitions: EVM network > Everscale network > another EVM network without the need to have a wallet or tokens in "EVER"

Works through a separate node called **credit processor**. It keeps track of transfers in different networks and gives credit in evers for depositing events, exchanging some part of the transfer to DEX (Decentralized Exchange) against payment of these commissions.
