# All transfers

The bottom block of the [**History section**](https://app.octusbridge.io/transfers) is **All transfers**.&#x20;

All recent transfers with Octus Bridge are displayed here. \
All transactions have several columns with information about them:&#x20;

* Transfer amount in tokens&#x20;
* Transaction type&#x20;
* Address and networks of recipient and sender&#x20;
* Transfer date

In the upper right part of the block, you can enable and configure transaction **search filters** by sender address, date, source and target blockchain, sent token, transaction status and type.
