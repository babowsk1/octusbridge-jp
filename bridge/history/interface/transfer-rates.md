# Transfer rates

The first block of the page - **Transfer rates.**\
Here you can see the Octus Bridge activity graph, where green indicates the number of tokens entered into the Everscale network, and red indicates the number of tokens withdrawn from the Everscale network. \
\
Additional information is also displayed on the left side of the block:&#x20;

* The number of transfers for all time.&#x20;
* Transfer volume in USD for the last 24 hours and 7 days.&#x20;
* The dollar amount transferred to and from Everscale for the entire time.

You can also change the display mode of the graph in its upper right part - by day or by hour.
