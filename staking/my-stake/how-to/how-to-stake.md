# How to Stake

To get started, go to the **My stake** section of the staking interface and [**connect the EVER Wallet**](../../../getting-started/how-to-connect-wallets.md#connect-wallets) if you haven't already.

Under My staking balance in the **amount field** you need to specify how much BRIDGE you want to stake. \
Or you can specify your maximum amount of BRIDGE by clicking on **MAX** button and click **Stake**.

Then you need to confirm this action in your wallet EVER. \
Note the commission is written 11.5 EVER. You will withdraw from a purse 11.5 EVER but most of them will return, in fact the commission will be approximately 2.8 EVER.

Upon successful completion of the transaction, you start to get reward every second, which will be burned in future Octus Bridge yield distribution and will be credited to us as bridge tokens. \
You can see your total amount of staked tokens at [**My staking performance**](../interface/my-staking-performance.md) block.
