# How to Redeem

To get started, go to the **My stake** section of the staking interface, find the **My staking balance** block and select the **Redeem** function.

At the **Amount** field you need to specify the desired number of tokens that you want to withdraw. In order to specify all available amount click **Max**.

After you have specified the amount, click **Redeem**.

Next, you need to confirm all actions in your EVER wallet. Note that you will need 11.5 EVER to pay for gas, most of which will be returned when the transaction is complete.

Now you need to wait a little bit for the operation to complete and your BRIDGE tokens will be in your EVER wallet.
