# My staking performance

The **My staking performance** section is needed to keep track of your staking balance activity and consists of 3 main sections:

* Balance section shows your overall staking balance.
* History section shows the history of your staking deposits, so that you can see the progress of your deposits.
* Reward section shows the amount of rewards you have earned.&#x20;
