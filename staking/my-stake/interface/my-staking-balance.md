# My staking balance

The **My Staking Balance** section is designed to deposit and withdraw BRIDGE tokens from your staking balance and receive earned rewards:

* The **Stake** window is necessary in order to make a deposit to Staking
* The **Redeem** window has two functions:&#x20;

1. **Claim** - Used to display accumulated rewards.&#x20;
2. **Redeem** - Outputs the desired amount of deposit that you made in Stacking.
