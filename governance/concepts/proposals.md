# Proposals

## How proposals work

It should be noted right away that in order to create a proposal, you need to have at least 100,000 BRIDGE tokens in staking.

After that, you fill out the [**Create new proposal**](../create-proposals/) form and submit it for review. Verification considers two main aspects

1. Usefulness for the network&#x20;
2. Technical feasibility

After verification, the proposal is sent to the vote. In order to be eligible to vote, the stakeholder must have BRIDGE tokens on their balance sheet. The significance of the stakeholder's voice directly depends on their number. Voters also have 3 voting options: For, Against and Abstain.

The weight of the vote is taken into account during the entire voting period in case the voter's BRIDGE balance has decreased or increased since the moment of voting.

After voting is completed, the proposal is assigned one of the following statuses: Accepted, Rejected, Canceled.

If the proposal is accepted, the team approves the technical solution, plans the implementation and improves the system.

The implementation of this voting works through open voting, i.e. information about how this or that vote was distributed can be viewed by anyone.
