# BRIDGE token

The main functional purpose of BRIDGE tokens is the management of [DAO](../).

Essentially, BRIDGE tokens represent your right to vote on various proposals. BRIDGE tokens are also required to participate in the Octus Bridge validation.

Three fundamental values ​​of the BRIDGE token:&#x20;

1. Voting rights (including pool liquidity management)&#x20;
2. The right to receive dividends (proportional to the stake amount)&#x20;
3. The ability to act as a relayer, which provides an additional income model.

You can also participate in farming by adding liquidity to one of the available pairs on FlatQube, receiving the same BRIDGE tokens as a reward. You can read more about farming in the [FlatQube documentation.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MUxjK3XWZCxuBwyXzkS/s/Hn2GVaDcxUKSq45GJhH0/)
