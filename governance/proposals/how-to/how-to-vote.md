# How to Vote

In order to take part in voting for a certain proposal, go to the page of this proposal in the **Governance** section.

On the right side of the page, you can select <mark style="color:green;">**Vote for**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">or</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Vote against**</mark>. \
When choosing one of these options, your vote equivalent to your **Voting power** will be counted, and Bridge tokens will be locked until the end of the voting for one of the reasons (canceled by created, failed, expired, succeeded, queued or executed), after which you can unlock them.
