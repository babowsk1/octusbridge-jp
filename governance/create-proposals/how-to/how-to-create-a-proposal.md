# How to create a proposal

To create a new proposal, go to the appropriate section of the **Governance** interface.

Here you need to fill in several fields:&#x20;

* **Title** - the name of the proposal.
* **Discussion link** - link to the page (github, forum, etc.) dedicated to the discussion of the proposal.&#x20;
* **Description** - a description of the proposal: its essence and usefulness for the network.

After filling in the appropriate fields, you can **add actions** (smart contracts)that will be performed by this proposal - this could be adding a new token, supporting a new network, etc.&#x20;

Fill in all relevant fields and click **Submit**.&#x20;
