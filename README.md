Octus Bridge is a platform built by the Broxus team that enables cross-chain asset transfers between Everscale and other networks such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Fantom and Polygon.

The platform also implements the [**Governance** ](governance/)interface or **DAO**, which provides a level of decentralization unprecedented for bridges due to the ability to make decisions directly by network participants, as well as a [**staking interface**](staking/).

Octus Bridge is a central part of Everscale DeFi ecosystem, allowing liquidity to move freely between blockchains to support other DeFi products and provide liquidity.
