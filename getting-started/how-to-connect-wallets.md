# How to connect wallets

In order to start working with Octus Bridge, you need to connect two wallets.\
At the moment, two wallets are available for connection:

[Metamask ](https://metamask.io/)is used to interact with Fantom, Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain. The user is thus able to switch between these networks directly in the browser extension.

[EVER Wallet](https://l1.broxus.com/freeton/wallet) is used to interact with the Everscale network.\
You can find a tutorial on how to install and use the EVER Wallet by following this [link](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MUxjK3XWZCxuBwyXzkS/s/vwtaQbYcgICT7ubKSITZ/).
